flac_transcode takes a directory containing FLAC audio files and transcodes them to a variety of formats. It
preserves the file structure of the source directory including any album art or log files.


Formats:

flac_transcode tries to preserve as much data from the original FLAC files but we're not always able to copy
certain metadata. Here's what is currently suppoted:

       transcodes files       copies tags        copies album art
mp3           X                   X                     X
ogg           X                   X
m4a           X
